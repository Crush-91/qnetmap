QNetMap is the library for displaying the map and the objects on it.

The project is based on the QMapControl library (http://qmapcontrol.sourceforge.net/) 
by Kai Winter. To show the map QNetMap can use different providers like OpenStreetMap 
or other WMS servers. The map data can be downloaded from the Internet or from the 
disk cache. User's own raster maps can also be used.

QNetMap supports layers so you can mix maps from different servers. To enrich the map 
presentation you can draw your own objects in the given coordinates.

The development of the library was supported by the "Sintels" LLC (ЗАО "Синтелс" - 
http://sintels.ru) and OJSC "T8" (ОАО "Т8" - https://t8.ru).
